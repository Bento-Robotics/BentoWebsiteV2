            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>WLS robotics formed in early
            2021, as Prof. Dr. Stefan May of the OHM university stumbled across an extracurricular technology course
            offered by our school, the WLS, and decided to lend support and introduce the world of robotics.<br><br>We
            lay focus on creating simple and easy-to-maintain educational robots using ROS, micro-ROS, EduArt's drive
            system and off-the-shelf electronics, with the goal of acquiring and passing on the skills and knowledge
            required to work on mobile platforms, be it mechanics, electronics, software or just plain old
            troubleshooting.</p>

            <p>This is Zyklop, our initial robot. It was our first real
            experience with ROS and professional robotics.<br><br>Zyklop is great at navigating rough terrain but has a
            deficit of sensors.</p>

        <section class="bento-section">
            <p>Bento-Box was the second addition to our robot family. It was be
            used at the Robocup in Bordeaux.<br><br>We chose the name mostly so that we can call it the bento \'Box\',
            but also because we presume it\'ll end up looking like a box, since this happened with Zyklop.</p>

        <section class="bento-section">
            <p>Bento-Box really struggles at climbing ledges and stairs. As
            EduArt offered us new hardware, we decided to try out a flipper-based robot, naming it Schäufele.<br><br>We
            are still learning how to make articulated tracks behave nicely, so Schäufele can be difficult at
            times.</p>
